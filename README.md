# Match-Product-Listings
Match product listings from a 3rd party retailer, against a set of known products.

This is a challenge from Sortable. The goal is to match product listings from a 3rd party retailer, e.g. “Nikon D90 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)” against a set of known products, e.g. “Nikon D90”.They provide me with a set of products and a set of price listings matching some of those products. The task is to match each listing to the correct product. Precision is critical.They prefer missed matches (lower recall) over incorrect matches, so i have to try hard to avoid false positives. A single price listing may match at most one product.
